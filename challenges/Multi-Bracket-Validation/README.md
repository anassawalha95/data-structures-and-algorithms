# Challenge Summary
build a function for multi brackets validatation 

## Challenge Description
build a function called multiBracketValidation that takes an input string and return true or false if the brackets, curly brackets, or paranthesis are a match on openning and closing

## Approach & Efficiency
Used a for loop toc check each character if its openning it will be added to a stack and if it a closing it will be compared with the top of the stack 

The time is O(N)

The Space is O(1)
