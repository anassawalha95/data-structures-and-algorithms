# Challenge Summary

expand singly Linked list by adding new method to it

## Challenge Description

Add new 3 method to the singly linked list that will:

1. Insert after an element.
2. Insert before and element.
3. Add new value at the end of the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
