# Challenge Summary
Build a Breadth-first Traversal.

## Challenge Description

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as it input and return a list of elements as breadth first

## Approach & Efficiency

It is implemented using a queue from queue class and a while loop. It takes in a tree, and outputs integers list of integars.
