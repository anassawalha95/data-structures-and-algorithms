# Quick Sort

**Quick sort:** is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.
The algorithem work by choosing an element from the list, called a pivot. The pivot is used to divide the list into two sub-lists. Reorder all the elements around the pivot, so that the smaller values are placed before it, and the larger values are placed after it. Once all this occurs, the pivot is in its final position. Then, the above steps are applied recursively to both sub-lists on the right and left of the pivot.

### Time and complexity

Quick sort complexity has O(log n) in its best case but the best case cant be reached because its unknown the worst case is O(n^2). While the space has the worst of O(n) and the best is O(logn)

### Pesudo Code

        ALGORITHM QuickSort(arr, left, right)
            if left < right
                // Partition the array by setting the position of the pivot value
                DEFINE position <-- Partition(arr, left, right)
                // Sort the left
                QuickSort(arr, left, position - 1)
                // Sort the right
                QuickSort(arr, position + 1, right)

        ALGORITHM Partition(arr, left, right)
            // set a pivot value as a point of reference
            DEFINE pivot <-- arr[right]
            // create a variable to track the largest index of numbers lower than the defined pivot
            DEFINE low <-- left - 1
            for i <- left to right do
                if arr[i] <= pivot
                    low++
                    Swap(arr, i, low)

            // place the value of the pivot location in the middle.
            // all numbers smaller than the pivot are on the left, larger on the right.
            Swap(arr, right, low + 1)
            // return the pivot index point
            return low + 1

        ALGORITHM Swap(arr, i, low)
            DEFINE temp;
            temp <-- arr[i]
            arr[i] <-- arr[low]
            arr[low] <-- temp
