# Challenge Summary

Build the stack and the queue data strcutue in java

## Challenge Description

create three classes for node, queue and stack in and add the following methods in each class

1. class stack

1. push: add new value
1. pop: remove value
1. is empty: to check if the stack is empty
1. peek: return the value

1. class queue:

1. enqueue: to add value
1. dequeue: remove value
1. is empty: to check if the stack is empty
1. peek: return the value

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach was used is nodes where each node is connected to another
The efficiency of the implementation is O(1)

## API

**Stack:**

1. `push(<any value type>)`;
2. `pop()`

**Queue:**

1. `enqueue(<any value type>)`
2. `dequeue()`

**Both classes(Stack & Queue has the same methods name and functionality) of these methods:**

1. `peek()`
2. `isEmpty()`
