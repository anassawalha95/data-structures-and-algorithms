# Hashmap LEFT JOIN

 build a function that takes two hashmap and return a data structure 

## Challenge

 build a function that called left join where it takes two hashmap and combine both values on the same key returning a two dimintional array  

## Approach & Efficiency

Time complexity is O(n^2) due to use a for loops

Space Complexity is O(n) due to use hashset

## Solution
