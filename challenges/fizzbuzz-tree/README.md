# Challenge Summary
build a fizz buzz with trees

## Challenge Description

build a fizz buzz with trees that takes a tree check for fizz buzz and change the values accordingly otherwise save the same value inside the new tree then return the new tree

## Approach & Efficiency

used loops to find check for the values and store them inside the new node tree 

 time O(n*k) the n for the loop and the k is the time repeated on all children

space O(n) for storing the new values inside the new tree
