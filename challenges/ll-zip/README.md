# Challenge Summary

expand singly Linked list by adding new method to search for values in the linked by index

## Challenge Description

create a new methoed that searches for a value based on an index start from the right to the left and check for:

1. if the index is greater than the length of the linked list
2. if the index and the length of the list are the same
3. if the index provided is negative
4. if the linked list is of a size 1
5. if the index is in the middle of the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach was considered is to validate the test cases if exists first then search for the desired value by the index.
Teh complixity is O(n).
