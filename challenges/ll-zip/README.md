# Challenge Summary

To combine two linked lists togather

## Challenge Description

create a new methoed called ll-zip that accept 2 linked list and combine them togather

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach was considered is to validate the test cases if exists first then append the elements in the second linked list to  the first.
Teh complixity is O(n).
