# Singly Linked List

Singly linked list is a data sturcture approch where it uses nodes to connect the data with each other

## Challenge

To build and applictation that implements the singly linked list

## Approach & Efficiency

- built with object oriented programming
- time and complixity in best cases is O(1) and worst cases is O(n)

## API

`insert(<Node type>)`: this method will add a Node to the linked list

`includes(<int>)`: this method will check for the value if it exists in the linked list or not return a boolean

`toString()`: this method will print the linked list
